Hello, My name is Martín García and I am a web developer, I'm from Galicia a little
región over Portugal, although im living in Barcelona. 

My passion is to develop web aplications with JavaScript.

At present im studying at Skylab Coders Academy, improving my knowledge about MERN
(MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS). 

I studied two Technical Degrees(web & softwer development). In my last year I've been studying in Göteborg(Sweden) as a Erasmus student for Gompute(HPC Cloud platform) company. 

In my free time I like to learn about new development tools like GoLang or Containers.
Im a really curious person so I'm always looking for new things to read and learn.

If im out of the computer I'll probably be exploring new places with my friends or doing sport(basketball 100%).
